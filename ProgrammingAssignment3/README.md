# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project\
\
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.\
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:\
\
1. Import the downloaded data\
2. Load the activity and feature info\
3. Loads both the training and test data sets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation\
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each data set, and merges those columns with the dataset\
5. Merges the two data sets\
6. Merge the data set with the activity labels\
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.\
\
The end result is shown in the variable keydates}
